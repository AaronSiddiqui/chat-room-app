# Simple Chat Room Application

## About

This is a simple chat application that was used to help me better understand multithreading, sockets and GUI elements using the javax.swing package in Java. The idea of this application is to create a locally run server with multiple chat clients with GUIs using multiple threads. As well as messaging, the application provides some additional functionality of changing the chat window background colour per user, and uploading your own profile picture (saved by the server).

## Usage

To run a simple test of the game using 1 chat server and 4 chat windows on localhost, run the **test/ChatAppTest.java** file with your favourite editor, IDE, or CLI tool (I personally ran this using an Eclipse project).

If you want to run your own scenarios, either modify this file or create your own tests.
